//MODULE ASSIGNMENT 2 - LEVEL 1

1. What is a function literal?

-A function literal is an unnamed function, it is used as an expression

2. What is the constructor?

-A constructor is a function to make an object. Used when working with prototype objects.

3. What does the return statement do?

The return statement stops the functions execution and returns a value.

4. What will be written to the console from this function:
		function myFunction(){
			  return console.log('inside my function');
			  console.log('My name is Andy');
		}
		myFunction();

Since we have a return function on the first console.log it will return "inside my function".

5. Briefly describe scope in JavaScript.

In JavaScript we have two scopes, Global and Local.
Global is when a variable is declared outside a function, like in the start of the document. 
It will be available for the rest of the document.

Local is when a variable is set inside a function. It will then not be available outside the function.

Global example:
var myGlobalVariable = something;
function myFunction() {
	"function black magic that uses myGlobalVariable"
};

Local example:
function myFunction() {
	var myLocalVariable = "This is a local variable that is not available outside the function";
};
